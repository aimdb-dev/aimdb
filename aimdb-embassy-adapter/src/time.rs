//! Embassy Time Integration for AimDB
//!
//! This module provides Embassy-specific implementations of AimDB's time traits,
//! enabling embedded applications to use timing functionality with Embassy's
//! time driver and timer primitives.

/// Time provider implementing both timestamp and sleep capabilities
///
/// This provider uses Embassy's time driver to provide both timestamp and sleep
/// functionality in embedded environments. It integrates with Embassy's timer
/// system and works without requiring std.
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # #[cfg(all(not(feature = "std"), feature = "embassy-time"))]
/// # {
/// use aimdb_embassy_adapter::time::TimeProvider;
/// use aimdb_core::time::{TimestampProvider, SleepCapable};
/// use embassy_time::Duration;
///
/// # async fn example() {
/// let provider = TimeProvider::new();
///
/// // Use as timestamp provider
/// let timestamp = provider.now();
///
/// // Use as sleep provider
/// provider.sleep(Duration::from_millis(50)).await;
/// # }
/// # }
/// ```
