# AimDB Task Planning and Breakdown

## Task Definition

Create a structured task breakdown for implementing a specified AimDB feature with proper sequencing, dependencies, and platform considerations.

### Requirements
- **Feature Scope**: Define clear boundaries and deliverables for the feature
- **Task Granularity**: Break down into manageable tasks (4-8 hours each)
- **Platform Coverage**: Consider embedded/edge/cloud implementation differences
- **Dependencies**: Identify task dependencies and critical path
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential blockers and mitigation strategies

### Constraints
- Follow AimDB's async-first architecture principles
- Maintain compatibility across all target platforms (MCU/edge/cloud)
- Ensure tasks align with performance requirements (<50ms reactivity)
- Consider memory constraints for embedded targets
- Include testing and documentation tasks
- Respect existing API contracts and interfaces

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature broken down into implementable tasks (4-8 hours each)
- [ ] Clear task dependencies and sequencing identified
- [ ] Platform-specific considerations documented
- [ ] Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined for each task
- [ ] Testing strategy integrated into task plan
- [ ] Documentation requirements specified
- [ ] Resource allocation and timeline estimates

## Planning Framework

## Example Task Breakdown

### Feature: MQTT Protocol Bridge Implementation

#### Task 1: MQTT-001-FOUNDATION
**Title**: MQTT Protocol Bridge Core Structure
**Category**: Core  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 6 hours  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Platform**: All  

**Description**: Implement the basic MQTT bridge structure with connection management and message routing.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] MQTT client connection establishment
- [ ] Basic pub/sub message handling
- [ ] Connection state management
- [ ] Error handling for connection failures
- [ ] Configuration structure defined

**Technical Notes**:
- Use `rumqttc` for MQTT client implementation
- Implement async connection management
- Design for reconnection resilience

**Risks**:
- Network connectivity issues in embedded environments
- Mitigation: Implement robust retry logic with exponential backoff

#### Task 2: MQTT-002-INTEGRATION
**Title**: AimDB Message Integration
**Category**: Core  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 8 hours  
**Dependencies**: MQTT-001-FOUNDATION  
**Platform**: All  

**Description**: Integrate MQTT bridge with AimDB's internal message system and data synchronization.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Bidirectional message translation (MQTT â†” AimDB)
- [ ] Topic mapping configuration
- [ ] QoS level handling
- [ ] Message serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Throughput meets performance requirements (>1000 msg/s)

**Technical Notes**:
- Implement zero-copy message translation where possible
- Use efficient serialization format (MessagePack/CBOR)
- Design for low-latency processing (<10ms per message)

**Risks**:
- Serialization overhead impacting performance
- Mitigation: Use binary protocols and implement message pooling

### Risk Management

#### Common Risk Categories
1. **Technical Risks**
   - Platform compatibility issues
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Third-party dependency problems
