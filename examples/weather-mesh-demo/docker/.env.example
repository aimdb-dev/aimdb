# Docker-in-Docker Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and set the host path to your project root
#
# This is needed because Docker-in-Docker requires host paths for volume mounts.
# The inner Docker daemon cannot see the outer container's filesystem.

# Set this to the absolute path of the project on your Docker HOST machine
# Example (macOS): /Users/username/projects/aimdb-server
# Example (Linux): /home/username/projects/aimdb-server
HOST_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/aimdb-server
