//! AimDB Executor Traits
//!
//! This crate provides pure trait definitions for async execution across different
//! runtime environments. It enables dependency inversion where the core database
//! depends on abstractions rather than concrete runtime implementations.
//!
//! # Design Philosophy
//!
//! - **Runtime Agnostic**: No concrete runtime dependencies in trait definitions
//! - **Clear Separation**: Dynamic vs static spawning models are explicit
//! - **Platform Flexible**: Works across std and no_std environments
//! - **Performance Focused**: Zero-cost abstractions where possible
//! - **Dependency Inversion**: Core depends on traits, adapters provide implementations
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! aimdb-executor (this crate)     ← Pure trait definitions
//!       ↑              ↑
//!       |              |
//! tokio-adapter   embassy-adapter  ← Concrete implementations  
//!       ↑              ↑
//!       |              |
//!       └─── aimdb-core ───┘      ← Uses any executor via traits
//! ```
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate is typically not used directly. Instead:
//! 1. Runtime adapters implement these traits
//! 2. Core database accepts any type implementing the traits
//! 3. Applications choose their runtime adapter
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - `std`: Enables error types that require std library
//! - `tokio-types`: Includes Tokio-specific types in trait signatures
//! - `embassy-types`: Includes Embassy-specific types in trait signatures
